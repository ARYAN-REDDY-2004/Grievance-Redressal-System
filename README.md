# Grievance-Redressal-System:
## Project Description:

The Grievance Redressal System is a web-based application designed to provide an efficient and user-friendly platform for citizens to register civic grievances and for government officials to manage and resolve them. The system focuses on organized complaint handling, status tracking, and role-based access, ensuring transparency and accountability in grievance management.

Unlike advanced automated systems, escalation in this project is handled manually by authorized officials, making it suitable for controlled administrative workflows and academic demonstration.

## 🎯 Objectives:

Enable citizens to submit grievances online

Provide officials with a centralized dashboard to manage complaints

Allow manual escalation and status updates

Improve transparency in grievance resolution
